          My goal was to teach myself to code. I used my philosophy background
          and affinity for logic to help me find the way. After just a couple of
          years I am able to design and develop solutions that represent
          everything my skills need to compete in the modern marketplace.

          <p>
            It began as a simple beginner project and grew out to be my biggest
            project yet. This game has it all, its own server engine, game
            engine and space engine. Manually crafted objects, behaviors,
            scenarios and events. It is a rpg-action-space-shooter, where you
            are a spaceship that can turn the world 360 degrees to dodge all
            kinds of enemies and obstacles, while doing quests, escorting
            damsels and flying through asteroid belts.

          <p>
            To create a simple little app or other software quickly, we can use
            an API. As a user of internet I can quickly connect to a vast amount
            of data on a server. I used a twitter api called 'Twit' and a
            Youtube Search Api, and created my own monster that can use both. I
            automated tweeting about videos I posted on my Youtube channel.

          <p>
            Counter Strike is a game I played since I was 12 years old and I
            have fond memories of those days. But I needed to know how got I
            still was. Therefore I created a stats tracker with the use of
            https://tracker.gg/csgo as API. Fill in your Counter Strike: Global
            Offensive ID number and check how much of a n00b you are (compared
            to me).

            This one was my first 'real' project to create a tiny game engine
            that could help me make games easier in the future. With the help of
            libraries as LibGDX and Ashley. By doing this, I showed myself that
            I had the skill to create something big out of nothing.

          <h3>The Reflex!</h3>
          <p>
            Unity has been mentioned by people who knew I was making games. So I
            began making a small game in Unity. I got introduced to Visual
            Studio for the first time, as well as C#. I had confidence in myself
            and with that I picked it up within a day. I surprised myself and
            made this game within a couple of days. It isn't a big game and not
            very creative, but it is the next step in my development as a
            developer.

          <p>
            For a game jam called js13kGames I entered this game. Made within
            three weeks in Javascript, from scratch, without any external
            libraries and it had to be 13k zipped. As well as a great learning
            method to teach myself javascript fast, it was also a great social
            experiment for me. To get to know the gaming dev community and how
            most are helpful and honest.

          <h3>Movie Search App</h3>
          <p>
            A small web app where we can search for our favorite movies, with
            the help of axios. Axios makes requests or promises from the browser
            by way of an API. In this case I am using the Omdb API. The api
            makes a request for a movie name for instance, the backend will
            request the Omdb server for that name, and the frontend will show
            the result to the user. This is a simple beginners app to learn the
            difference between frontend and backend and to understand what it
            means to do requests.

            multilingual landing page with a embedded ticker widget and cryto
            market widget. It is a responsive website, so it also look great on
            mobile apparatuses. It also was deployed on Netlify.

          <p>
            I made another search app, only this time for music. Search for
            lyrics and info about artists. By way off both the MusixMatch and
            Last.fm API. I also used a json file for a full list of countries to
            easily create top10's for all the countries. In this project I also
            finally tried to create animations for certain components in the
            DOM.

            The World's Interconnective Study Experience is a social network
            site for people who like to learn and also teach others. It is used
            as a hub for everything that you know and would like to know. You
            can create a study item and add documents so that other can learn
            from your studies. People can form a "classroom" and discuss a
            certain topic together, all in the name of knowledge gathering. It
            is build with React, a javascript library for building user
            interfaces. I used MongoDB as a database, Express as a web framework
            and of course Node.js as runtime environment: The MERN Stack.

            David is a motivated self-taught developer with a versatile
            background looking for further development of his skills in a
            professional environment. With extensive creativity, the ability to
            see situations from different perspectives and a good sense of
            logic, programming was the ideal route to follow. After following
            different creative ambitions for a period, a greater challenge was
            sought, a place where his creativity and reasoning could come
            together. The focus of the study was primarily on learning the Java
            programming language, while emphasizing the correct modulation of
            the code. From an idea, study work was sought out and then various
